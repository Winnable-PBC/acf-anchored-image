# ACF Anchored Image Field Type

This WordPress plugin provides a custom field type for [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) that allows the content admin to specify an anchor point for an image.

The anchor point can be used to set an `object-position` style property on the image. In cases where the image must fit within a fixed aspect ratio, this is then used to set the preferred center point of the image.
